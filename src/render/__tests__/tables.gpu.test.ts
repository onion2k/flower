/**
 * The set drawn on every table the renderer offers.
 *
 * This is here for one bug. The reflection a polished face shows of the table
 * is worked out by running a ray from the face down to the disc and shading
 * the table where it lands. Every test guarding that ray — is it pointing
 * downward, is the distance positive, did it land inside the disc — was
 * written as a comparison that a NaN passes: "dir.z >= -1e-4" is false for a
 * NaN, so a ray that was not a direction at all went through to be
 * intersected, and the table was asked what it looked like at a point that
 * was not a point.
 *
 * Matte does not read the point it is given, so it answered anyway. Every
 * other table — the woods, the slate, the cloths — reads it and answered NaN.
 * That went into the light probe; the probe is prefiltered down a mip chain,
 * and that chain is what every reflective surface in the frame reads. One bad
 * ray turned the whole picture black, piece, table and all.
 *
 * What this test does NOT do is reproduce that. The failure was found with a
 * chess set on a board driven by a program of its own — men in groups that
 * move, standing where a game had put them — and it has not been cornered
 * into a scene small enough to keep here; the sketch below, drawn from the
 * same view, comes out right either way. So read this as what it is: a check
 * that every table draws something rather than nothing, which is the shape
 * the failure took, and a place to record it. If a table ever comes back
 * blank, this is the first thing to run and the note above is the first thing
 * to read.
