/**
 * Solder fillets: the meniscus where one part is fastened to another.
 *
 * Two parts that merely intersect look glued. Real joins are soldered, and the
 * solder wets both surfaces and pulls into a concave sweep from the thinner
 * member onto the face it meets. That sweep is small and it is everywhere, and
 * its absence is one of the things that makes an assembly read as parts stacked
 * in software.
 *
 * A fillet is a revolved quarter-round placed at the mating anchor: it wraps the
 * post — whichever of the two members is thinner at the join — and flares onto
 * the plate. Nothing is cut or merged; the ring simply overlaps both, which is
 * exactly what solder does.
