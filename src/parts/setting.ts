 * The metal that holds a stone.

 * A stone is not soldered to anything; it is trapped, and the two ways of
 * trapping it look entirely different. A bezel is a wall of metal round the
 * whole girdle with a ledge inside for the stone to sit on and a rim rubbed
 * over its edge — it protects the stone and shows the least of it. Claws hold
 * it at a few points on a collet ring, which shows nearly the whole stone and
 * lets light in underneath, which is why every stone meant to sparkle is set
 * that way.
 *
 * Its `seat` anchor is the girdle plane, so `fasten stone to mount.seat` drops
 * a stone of the same width into it; `base` is the underside, so the mount
 * itself fastens to a plate the way any other fitting does.
