 * A lever-back earring finding: a wire loop through the lobe, closed by a
 * hinged paddle pressed across the gap rather than left open like a fish
 * hook or squeezed shut like a jump ring — the secure fastening most studs
 * and small drops actually use.
 *
 * There is no real hinge here, only its resting, worn silhouette: the loop
 * is shank's gap construction again, and the lever is a second, shorter arc
 * bridging the same gap the short way, pinched down to wire gauge at both
 * ends so it reads as pivoting from the loop rather than welded across it.
 * The `seat` anchor sits at the gap's own centre, in front of both — where a
 * stud or a small drop mounts to hide the hinge and catch, the way a
 * rivet's `seat` hides its head.
