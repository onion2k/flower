/**
 * A ring shank: a band sized to a finger, with a crown anchor to fasten a
 * setting onto — or, with a gap, to seat a stone gripped directly between
 * the two cut ends.
 *
 * `size` is the inner diameter, the thing a ring's own size actually means —
 * everything else (width, thickness, the shoulder) is built outward from it,
 * the way a shank is cut from stock rather than drawn from a centreline.
 * Without a gap the crown sits at the seam the closed sweep starts and ends
 * on, angle zero, so a shoulder swell has to straddle both ends of the taper
 * table rather than just the start of it. With a gap the sweep runs open
 * instead, from one side of the crown round to the other, and the same
 * straddling shoulder now falls exactly at its two cut ends — which is where
 * a tension setting wants its own swell anyway, since that is where the
 * spring of the metal actually does the gripping.
