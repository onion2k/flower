/**
 * A round shield: a shallow domed disc with a raised boss at the centre —
 * over the hand, on a real one — and a grip bar across the back of it.
 *
 * Built the way `bell` builds a thin turned shell: one centreline profile
 * in (radius, height), offset by half the wall thickness to a front and a
 * back curve, revolved as a single closed loop rather than two separate
 * discs. The boss is not a second merged piece the way a sword's pommel
 * is — it is a bump added to the same centreline function the dome itself
 * is, so the shell stays one continuous, uniformly-thick surface through
 * it, the way a boss actually is raised from the same sheet as the rest of
 * the face.
 *
 * Faces +Z, the way it would lying face-up on a table or a stand; `pitch
 * 90deg` at `place` turns it to face outward instead, the way it would
 * hang on a wall or be held.
