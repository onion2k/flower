 * A pearl: the first thing in the vocabulary that is not metal.
 *
 * Geometrically it is nothing — a sphere, or a slightly flattened one — and it
 * is here for its material. Nacre is a stack of aragonite plates in a protein
 * matrix, translucent enough that light gets under the surface and comes back
 * out diffused, with a soft lustre on top and an iridescent sheen that turns
 * with the view. All of that lives in the shader; the part just declares that
 * it wants it.
 *
 * Origin at the centre, seat at the bottom pole, so it pegs onto a post the way
 * a pearl is set — glued over a pin rather than riveted through.
